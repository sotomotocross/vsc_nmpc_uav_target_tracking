# Vision-based NMPC for target tracking using UAVs
This is a ROS C++ package of various vison-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategies for UAV aiming on target tracking. The general application of these controllers is a dynamic coastline in the presenc of waves.
The different version of visual servoing will be analyzed below.
The controllers were all developed in a UAV synthetic simulation environment: https://github.com/sotomotocross/UAV_simulator_ArduCopter.git
